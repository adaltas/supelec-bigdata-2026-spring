    "The command above works well for loading data from parquet files because parquet is a self descibing file format, meaning that the metadata needed to build the dataframe is included directly in the format. However, when working with other formats such as csv or json, a schema must be provided or infered. In production code the schema should always be explicitly provided but during the data exploration phase it is acceptable to infer the schema, and when infering the schema it often best to use `.option(\"samplingRatio\", <small-portion-of-data>)` to avoid using the entire dataset for schema inference.\n",
